The ultra-thin, robust chassis design allows vehicles to easily overrun the Stride without damaging the vehicle or the platform. Features Unmatched Versatility The Stride can be deployed alone or coordinated with other platforms and vehicles in complex test scenarios. Thanks to a cost that is a fraction of the competition, the Stride is ideal for fleet deployment in scenarios requiring numerous pedestrians. Available with either open-source software or the S-E-A\u2019s proprietary Impel software. S-E-A Impel S-E-A\u2019s software provides a powerful interface capable of controlling and coordinating S-E-A\u2019s entire ecosystem of robotics products, including platforms and driving robots. Test engineers can easily script trajectory and speed profiles and coordinate movement between robotic platforms and test vehicles. ROS Created in ROS, the software provides an even more affordable alternative and allows maximum flexibility for customers who wish the use their own control or coordination software.
